# Competitive markets 

.pull-left[

Conditions of competitive market 

- Producers

  - Face competition
  
  - Face no barriers to entry or exit 

- Consumers: 
  
  - Are .red[perfectly informed] of benefits and prices of all goods
  
  - Bear all costs and receive all benefits (No .red[externalities])
  
- There are no 'public Good' characteristics 

- Products are identical (price is only factor)

# Competitive markets: Market vs. individual firm 

&lt;center&gt; 

&lt;img src="libs/pic/F9.1.jpg" width="80%"&gt;

### As a result firms and consumers are market .red[price takers]

### Under the competitive market, it reaches .red[efficiency] 

---
# Efficient market presented in health care?

- Lack of competition (monopoly, oligopoly)

- Externalities

- Public Goods

- Uncertainty (insurance markets, moral hazard and adverse selection)

- Imperfect information (supplier induced demand) 

- Barriers to entry

---
# Government intervention to address market failure 

1. Regulations

  - Price control 

2. Financial incentives 

  - Taxation 

  - Subsidy 

---
# Some favor government involvement in medical care 

- Medicine is too complicated to be left to market forces

- Medicine difficult to understand; patents must rely on doctors

- Medical care is a social good, too important for the impersonal marketplace

- Externalities in medicine, especially infectious diseases, require collective action to protect society

- Provision of medical care based on the ability to pay is morally repugnant
---
# Some oppose government involvement in medical care

- U.S. system has remained mostly market-based

- This is evidence of deep American distrust of federal government involvement in health care matters

- Experience: government-run programs are costly

---
# Market failure

.pull-left[

&gt; Markets fail to allocate resources optimally when firms have .red[market power], when there
are .red[externalities] in consumption and production, and when the good produced is a .red[public good].

&gt; Market power: Market power is depicted graphically by any .red[departure] from perfectly elastic demand curves

# Market failure in medical markets

- Lack of competition (monopoly, oligopoly)

- Externalities

- Public Goods

- Uncertainty (insurance markets, moral hazard and adverse selection)

- Imperfect information (supplier induced demand) 

- Barriers to entry

# Market failure 1: Public goods 

.pull-left[

Definition: A public good is ‘a good or service that can be consumed simultaneously by everyone
and from which no individuals can be excluded'.

  - non-rival 
  
  - non-excludable
]

.pull-right[

Is health care a public goods? why or why not

# Market failure 2: Monopoly 

.pull-left[

&lt;center&gt; 

&lt;img src="libs/pic/F9.2.jpg" width="130%"&gt;
]

.pull-right[

### Government interventions

  - Regulations 
  
    - Price controls 
    
    - Entry restrictions 
    
    - Limits on new product development 
    
  - Tax policy 

]

---
# Market failure 3: Externalities 

- Definition: An externality is a cost or a benefit arising from an economic transaction that
falls on people who do not participate in the transaction

- A benefit in this case is called a positive externality or external benefit.

- A cost is called a negative externality or external cost.

- Policy issue – design of appropriate institutions, legislation and regulation to align individual
incentives and social welfare

---
# Postive externality 

  - Private benefit
  
    - direct benefit to consumers who buy and consume good

  - Social benefit
  
    - indirect benefit to all in society, including those who do not consume it
    
        - Vaccination (herd immunity effect)
        
        - ‘Caring externality’ – others in society care that other people might not be able to receive treatment
        
    - Cause market failure (too little consumption)
    
        - Demand curve = ‘marginal private benefit’ (MPB)
        
        - But, where positive externalities exist, additional ‘marginal social benefits’ (MSB)
        
---

# Externality leads to market failure 

.pull-left[

### Why? 

-  Where externalities exist, the price
mechanism does not result in allocative
efficiency, therefore market failure.

- With positive externalities people that
would benefit are not buying the product

- Therefore there is under supply of
product and ‘deadweight' social loss

### Government interventions 

  - Subsidy/Tax 
  
  - Regulations of quantity produced 
  
  - Property rights to ‘correct’ market

# Market failure 4: Asymmetry of information

Definition: Asymmetry of information exists when one person in an economic transaction has more relevant information than the other person. 

In health care settings, asymmetry may rise three issues: in the medical care market, it leads to .red[supply induced demand]; in the health insurance market, it leads to .red[adverse selection] and .red[moral hazard]

---
# Supply induced demand 

.pull-left[

- Definition: Increased demand as a result of a provider (e.g. a doctor) exploiting
an asymmetry of information. 

  - More generally, observation that when faced
with shock to equilibrium (eg increase supply),
health providers may respond by ‘inducing
demand’ (shift demand curve) for their services

- It is also an agent problem. 

  - In practice, health providers (like other human
beings!) are not perfect at putting the interests of
others before their own interests

- Why does it lead to inefficiency: 

  - It led to the unnecessary use of medical services for consumers

# Moral hazard 

.pull-left[

- Definition: Moral hazard occurs anytime there is an opportunity to gain from acting differently
from the implied principles of a contract: The contract changes consumer’s behaviors

- Because private actions are hidden from view, both parties have an opportunity to
gain from unpredictable behavior

- Having insurance:

  - Increases the likelihood of purchasing medical services
  
  - Induces higher spending in the event of illness
]
  
.pull-right[

### Potential loss from moral hazard

&lt;center&gt; 

&lt;img src="libs/pic/F9.4.png" width="130%"&gt;
]
---
# User fees and moral hazard 

 - User charges (co-payments) can be viewed as a means of reducing moral hazard

  - Reduces utilization of health care by patients

- But there are problems:

  - Disproportionately affects lower income groups

  - Demand is reduced for effective treatments as well as trivial health care

  - May not reduce consumption if doctors induce demand
 
 
---

# Adverse selection 

.pull-left[
- Adverse selection arises because

  - Individuals may have better information of their risk
status than does the insurance company

  - Individuals with a low risk of requiring
health care may find it difficult to obtain
”actuarially fair” insurance – premium equal
to expected cost of future consumption

  - Those with lower risk will not purchase
insurance priced to cater for those with
average risk, whereas higher risk individuals
will, SO…
]

.pull-right[

- … average risk level of those remaining will
rise (as will premium) (continually)

- Result: those at low risk (and high risk with
low income) not insured (as premium rises)

- Solutions:

  - Private insurance may ‘experience rate’ (set a
different premium for different risk groups)

  - Compulsory public insurance. Stops low risk
leaving market (forced cross-subsidisation of
those at high risk by those at low risk)
