Conditions of competitive market 

- Producers

  - Face competition
  
  - Face no barriers to entry or exit 

- Consumers: 
  
  - Are .red[perfectly informed] of benefits and prices of all goods
  
  - Bear all costs and receive all benefits (No .red[externalities])
  
- There are no 'public Good' characteristics 

- Products are identical (price is only factor)

# Government intervention to address market failure 

1. Regulations

  - e.g., Price control 

2. Financial incentives 

  - Taxation 

  - Subsidy

# Some favor government involvement in medical care 

- Medicine is too .red[complicated] to be left to market forces

- Medicine difficult to understand; patents must rely on .red[doctors]

- Medical care is a .red[social good], too important for the impersonal marketplace

- .red[Externalities] in medicine, especially infectious diseases, require collective action to protect society

- Provision of medical care based on the ability to pay is .red[morally repugnant]
---
# Some oppose government involvement in medical care

- U.S. system has remained mostly market-based

- This is evidence of deep American distrust of federal government involvement in health care matters

- Experience: government-run programs are .red[costly]

# Market failure

.pull-left[

> Markets fail to allocate resources optimally when firms have .red[market power], when there
are .red[externalities] in consumption and production, and when the good produced is a .red[public good].

> Market power: Market power is depicted graphically by any .red[departure] from perfectly elastic demand curves

# Market failure 1: Public goods 

.pull-left[

Definition: A public good is ‘a good or service that can be consumed simultaneously by everyone
and from which no individuals can be excluded'.

  - non-rival 
  
  - non-excludable

---
# Market failure 3: Externalities 

- Definition: An externality is a .red[cost] or a .red[benefit] arising from an economic transaction that
falls on people who do not participate in the transaction

- A benefit in this case is called a .red[positive externality] or .red[external benefit].

- A cost is called a .red[negative externality] or external cost.

- Policy issue – design of appropriate institutions, legislation and regulation to align individual
incentives and social welfare

---
# Postive externality 

- Private benefit

  - .red[Direct benefit] to .red[consumers] who buy and consume good

- Social benefit
  
  - .red[Indirect benefit to all] in society, including those who do not consume it
  
      - Vaccination (herd immunity effect)
      
      - ‘Caring externality’ – others in society care that other people might not be able to receive treatment
      
  - Cause market failure (too little consumption)
    
      - Demand curve = ‘marginal private benefit’ (MPB)
  
      - But, where positive externalities exist, additional ‘marginal social benefits’ (MSB)
        
---

# Externality leads to market failure 

.pull-left[

### Why? 

-  Where externalities exist, the price mechanism does .red[not] result in allocative efficiency, therefore market failure.

- With positive externalities people that would benefit are not buying the product

- Therefore there is under supply of product and .red[‘deadweight'] social loss

### Government interventions 

  - Subsidy/Tax 
  
  - Regulations of quantity produced

# Market failure 4: Asymmetry of information

- Definition: 

  - .red[Asymmetry of information] exists when one person in an economic transaction has more relevant information than the other person. 

- In health care settings, asymmetry of information raises three issues: 

- In the medical care market, it leads to 

  - .red[Supplier-induced demand]; 

- in the health insurance market, it leads to 

  - .red[Adverse selection]
  
  - .red[Moral hazard]

---
# Supply induced demand 

.pull-left[

- Definition: Increased .red[demand] as a result of a provider (e.g. a doctor) exploiting
an asymmetry of information. 

  - More generally, observation that when faced with shock to equilibrium (e.g., .red[increase supply]), health providers may respond by .red[‘inducing demand’] (shift demand curve) for their services

- It is also an agent problem

  - In practice, health providers (like other human beings!) are not perfect at putting the interests of others before their own .red[interests]

- Why does it lead to inefficiency: 

  - .red[Unnecessary use] of medical services for consumers

# Moral hazard 

.pull-left[

- Definition: Moral hazard occurs anytime there is an opportunity to gain from acting differently
from the implied principles of a contract

  - .red[The contract changes consumer’s behaviors]

- Because private actions are hidden from view, both parties have an opportunity to gain from unpredictable behavior

- Having insurance:

  - Increases the likelihood of purchasing medical services
  
  - Induces higher spending in the event of illness

# User fees and moral hazard 

.pull-left[

 - User charges (co-payments) can be viewed as a means of reducing moral hazard

  - Reduces utilization of health care by patients

- But there are problems:

  - Disproportionately affects lower income groups

  - Demand is reduced for effective treatments as well as trivial health care

  - May not reduce consumption if doctors induce demand

# Adverse selection 

.pull-left[
- Adverse selection arises because

  - Individuals may have .red[better information] of their risk status than does the insurance company

  - Individuals with a low risk of requiring health care may find it difficult to obtain ”actuarially fair” insurance – premium equal to expected cost of future consumption

  - Those with .red[lower risk] will .red[not purchase insurance] priced to cater for those with
average risk, whereas higher risk individuals will, SO…
]

.pull-right[

- … average risk level of those remaining will
rise (as will premium) (continually)

- Result: those at .red[low risk] (and high risk with
low income) .red[not insured] (as premium rises)

- Solutions:

  - Private insurance may .red[‘experience rate’] (set a
different premium for different risk groups)

  - Compulsory .red[public insurance]. Stops low risk
leaving market (forced cross-subsidisation of
those at high risk by those at low risk)

# Three types of goods 

- Public goods: .red[Non-exclusive] and/or .red[non-rival] in consumption

  - Example: Defense, public infrastructure, clean water

- Merit goods: A good which when consumed provides external benefits, although
these may not be fully recognised

  - Services whose consumption produces .red[greater social benefits] than private benefit, such as
family planning

  - Services producing .red[externalises], such as vaccination

  - Services possessing significant .red[interpersonal utility values], emergency services for trauma patients

  - Services where individuals .red[lack sufficient education or rationality] to make rational
consumption decision, such has .red[preventive services]

- Private goods: Services that .red[exclusively] benefit the persons who consume them and
that if consumed by one person, can’t be consumed by another(.red[rival]).

# Lessons for developing countries

- Commercial insurance market

  - .red[Regulation] (e.g. subsidies) has proven to be largely .red[ineffective] and .red[costly] in correct failures in the Private insurance market

  - Clinical-service market failure can be corrected through .red[price and quantity regulations]:

      - prospective budgets
